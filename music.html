        <blockquote>"I think the rocks gods have given us crusty old classic rock fans down below a mighty gift, and we ought to be bowing before them in 
            gratitude for their beneficence, magnanimity, and generosity. There is an energy, an excitement, a fire in this music no golden age 
            classic rocker has been able to summon for more than three decades...I’ll take this over a new album from any of those old wornout 
            70s bands any day...Greta Van Fleet has earned our praise, not our scorn. This is a fantastic album from a band that has brought the 
            magic back to rock music." <cite>-Brutally Honest Rock Album Reviews</cite> </blockquote>

    <blockquote>"The songs are new and fresh and confirmed this reviewer’s suspicion that Greta Van Fleet was a band on its way to the top not only 
        because of its raw musical talent and stage presence but because it has the ability to write its own music. Few bands have been this 
        tight and polished and articulate, yet still raw, straight out of high school. Anthem of the Peaceful Army was written and recorded 
        during the band’s first full year of touring, demonstrating that they have the discipline and work ethic needed to succeed and sustain 
        a career as rock stars." <cite>- Blues Rock Review</cite> </blockquote>

    <blockquote>"From the glowing organ, rattling drum-fill and jangling riff that kick into sprawling opener Heat Above, they're in comfortable territory, 
            pushing at an easy pace towards the wide horizon. As Josh Kiszka pipes up with that immense vocal (‘Can you feel my looove?’), though, 
            indebted more to Rush's Geddy Lee than Zepp's Robert Plant this time out, there is a pulsating dynamism and a willingness to reach for 
            even bigger sounds than before. The thrusting guitars of My Way, Soon counteract a retro aesthetic with the youthful urgency of musicians
             still in their early twenties."<cite> - Kerrang </cite></blockquote>
